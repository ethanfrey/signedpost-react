# SignedPost React

A simple React-based UI for the tendermint app signedpost.

This is *heavily* based on the template from https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot
Much thanks to coryhouse and all other contributers

# Getting started

First, make sure you have node installed, like a recent version.
And it is nice to use chrome and install [Redux Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

```
npm install
npm start
```

At this point, you should see http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.  Check it out.

If something doesn't work, then check out the much better instructions on the [original starter kit](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)
